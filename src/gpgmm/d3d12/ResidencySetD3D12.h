    A residency set helps track heaps for residency which will be referenced together by a
    command-list. The application uses a ResidencySet by inserting heaps, by calling
    ResourceAllocation::GetMemory, into the set. Once ResidencyManager::ExecuteCommandLists is
    called, the set can be reset or cleared for the next frame.

    Without a ResidencySet, the application would need to manually ResidencyManager::LockHeap and
    ResidencyManager::UnlockHeap each heap before and after ResidencyManager::ExecuteCommandLists,
    respectively.
